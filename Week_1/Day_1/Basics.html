<!-- "Internet" is a long piece of wire(actually optical fibre wires passed through the oceans and cell towers contains Transmitters and receivers on the earth surface) which connects different computers or internet based systems(like servers, mobiles) using IP addresses.
Internet is used to send and receive data in the form of Optical signals(through optical wires in oceans) and Radio signals(through air on the surface of the earth using cell towers).
Optical wires(ends at coastal regions having separate stations) and Cell Towers are connected with the help of "terrestial fiber optic networks".
Reason behind "wifi speed" is faster because of Optical signals and in "mobile internet" is slower than wifi due to Radio signals
When you "type and then search a website" in web browser the browser will send a message(that message is "i want to see this website or webpage") to "Internet Service provider"(like Airtel, Jio) and this ISP will then relay that message to DNS server(Domain name system server) which is a like phonebook but it stores IP addresses of websites and systems in its database and once it locates IP address it sends it back to the browser in your computer through the ISP.Using this IP address,the browser in your computer will send direct request(containing IP address of the website) to "Server" through ISP.The Server(eg.,Google server) recieves that request and collects all the files required to opening that website will send them to the browser in your computer having Ip addresses through the ISP.
"Web User(User)" is a person who used to search the web sites in the web browser. 
"Web browser(Client)" is a software application used to access and view websites and web pages on the internet.
"Web server(Server)" is used to store files related to websites with their IP addreses.
"IP address" is a address given to every internet connected systems.
"Web site" is a collection of interconnected web pages.
"Web page" is an HTML document that can be accessible(can seen or update) through a "web browser".
   Types of Websites:
   1)"Static Website" is a website that can seen by everyone but it can be accessible(posting and storing their data) to everyone.Only the Creator of that website.
   eg.,blogs,portfolio
   2)"Dynamic Website" is a website that can be seen and accessible by everyone(but only to posting and storing their data but not developing of website)
    eg.,social media websites,e-commerce websites like amazon,flipkart etc.. -->
<!--"Web designing or <Web development" is the process of designing website.
   Web developers are 3 types:
   1)Front-End developer or client side developer (In Front-End,"Front" is a part of the website the interfaces or sees by the user and "end" means side orpart of the application)
     eg.,HTML,CSS,Javascript are used to design a website for providing previosly designed and stored content to the user.
   2)Back-End developer or Server side developer or Software developer(In Back-End,"Back" means Server.so,"Back-End" means "server-side" of the application where the data is processed,stored,and managed.)
     eg.,Javascript(nodejs),Databases like SQL etc.. are used to apply logic so that user can access and store their data safely.
   3)Full stack developer(designs both Front-End, Back-End and some part of databases) -->

        <!-- "Paragraph tags" are used to create paragraphs -->
        <p>India's history is rich and diverse, dating back thousands of years. The Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world's oldest urban cultures, flourished around 2500 BCE in what is now modern-day Pakistan and northwest India. Following the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, the Vedic Period began around 1500 BCE, marked by the composition of the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. This era saw the rise of the Mahajanapadas, sixteen powerful and influential kingdoms. By 326 BCE, Alexander the Great had invaded northwest India, although his presence was short-lived. The Maurya Empire, established in 322 BCE by Chandragupta Maurya, unified most of India for the first time. Under Emperor Ashoka, the empire expanded to its greatest extent, and Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism had a lasting impact on Indian culture and religion.</p>
        <p>The subsequent centuries saw the rise and fall of several dynasties, including the Gupta Empire, which is often regarded as a golden age of Indian culture, science, and political administration. The medieval period witnessed the rise of Islamic empires, such as the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. The Mughal Empire, particularly under rulers like Akbar the Great, led to a flourishing of arts, architecture, and cultural synthesis. However, by the 18th century, the empire weakened, paving the way for European colonial powers, primarily the British, to establish dominance. British rule, which lasted until 1947, significantly influenced India's political, social, and economic structures. India's struggle for independence, led by figures like Mahatma Gandhi, culminated in the nation gaining freedom in 1947, subsequently partitioning into India and Pakistan.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;India's geological history is complex and spans several billion years. The Indian subcontinent was once part of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana, which began to break apart around 180 million years ago. The Indian Plate separated from Gondwana and started moving northwards, eventually colliding with the Eurasian Plate about 50 million years ago. This monumental collision gave rise to the Himalayas, the world's youngest and highest mountain range. The ongoing tectonic activity continues to influence the region, contributing to seismic events and shaping the landscape. The Indian shield, comprising the peninsular region, is one of the oldest and most stable parts of Earth's crust, with some rocks dating back over 3 billion years.</p>
        <p>The geology of India is diverse, encompassing a range of geological features and rock types. The Deccan Traps, one of the largest volcanic provinces in the world, formed around 65 million years ago due to extensive volcanic activity. These basaltic lava flows cover much of central and western India and are linked to the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. The Thar Desert, or Great Indian Desert, in the northwest, presents a stark contrast to the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain, which is among the most productive agricultural regions globally. Rich in mineral resources, India has significant deposits of coal, iron ore, manganese, bauxite, and limestone, which have been exploited for industrial development. The diverse geological landscape not only provides resources but also poses challenges such as earthquakes and landslides, particularly in the tectonically active Himalayan region.</p>
