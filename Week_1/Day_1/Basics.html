        <!-- "Paragraph tags" are used to create paragraphs -->
        <p>India's history is rich and diverse, dating back thousands of years. The Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world's oldest urban cultures, flourished around 2500 BCE in what is now modern-day Pakistan and northwest India. Following the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, the Vedic Period began around 1500 BCE, marked by the composition of the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. This era saw the rise of the Mahajanapadas, sixteen powerful and influential kingdoms. By 326 BCE, Alexander the Great had invaded northwest India, although his presence was short-lived. The Maurya Empire, established in 322 BCE by Chandragupta Maurya, unified most of India for the first time. Under Emperor Ashoka, the empire expanded to its greatest extent, and Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism had a lasting impact on Indian culture and religion.</p>
        <p>The subsequent centuries saw the rise and fall of several dynasties, including the Gupta Empire, which is often regarded as a golden age of Indian culture, science, and political administration. The medieval period witnessed the rise of Islamic empires, such as the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. The Mughal Empire, particularly under rulers like Akbar the Great, led to a flourishing of arts, architecture, and cultural synthesis. However, by the 18th century, the empire weakened, paving the way for European colonial powers, primarily the British, to establish dominance. British rule, which lasted until 1947, significantly influenced India's political, social, and economic structures. India's struggle for independence, led by figures like Mahatma Gandhi, culminated in the nation gaining freedom in 1947, subsequently partitioning into India and Pakistan.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;India's geological history is complex and spans several billion years. The Indian subcontinent was once part of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana, which began to break apart around 180 million years ago. The Indian Plate separated from Gondwana and started moving northwards, eventually colliding with the Eurasian Plate about 50 million years ago. This monumental collision gave rise to the Himalayas, the world's youngest and highest mountain range. The ongoing tectonic activity continues to influence the region, contributing to seismic events and shaping the landscape. The Indian shield, comprising the peninsular region, is one of the oldest and most stable parts of Earth's crust, with some rocks dating back over 3 billion years.</p>
        <p>The geology of India is diverse, encompassing a range of geological features and rock types. The Deccan Traps, one of the largest volcanic provinces in the world, formed around 65 million years ago due to extensive volcanic activity. These basaltic lava flows cover much of central and western India and are linked to the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. The Thar Desert, or Great Indian Desert, in the northwest, presents a stark contrast to the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain, which is among the most productive agricultural regions globally. Rich in mineral resources, India has significant deposits of coal, iron ore, manganese, bauxite, and limestone, which have been exploited for industrial development. The diverse geological landscape not only provides resources but also poses challenges such as earthquakes and landslides, particularly in the tectonically active Himalayan region.</p>
